# 五种免费的 Jupyter Notebook 平台

## 什么是 Jupyter Notebook

> Jupyter Notebook (aka notebook) is an open-source web application that allows us to create and share codes and documents.

It provides an environment, where you can document your code, run it, look at the outcome, visualize data and see the results without leaving the environment. This makes it a handy tool for performing end to end data science workflows — data cleaning, statistical modeling, building and training machine learning models, visualizing data, and many, many other uses.(find more here)
